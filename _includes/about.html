                                      Before Jesus left this world, he left us with one final command known as the Great Commission,
                                      "Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations,
                                      baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
                                      Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you."
                                      With the Great Commission in mind,
                                       the Young Adult Ministries group at First Church of the Open Bible is called "GO"
                                       with our goal being to go into the world to proclaim the good news, make disciples, and serve those in need.
                                     </br></br>
                                      "GO" Young Adult Ministries will meet on Wednesday evenings at 6:30 at First Church of the Open Bible in Ottumwa, Iowa.
                                      During this time, we will study the life of Jesus Christ,
                                      discover who He really was, and what His true purpose was on earth,
                                      and to learn how we can best live like Him.</br>
                                      Outside of Wednesday nights,
                                       we will schedule activities such bowling,
                                       movie nights, game nights, concerts, conferences, etc.
                                       so that we can build better relationships with each other while growing in our faith.
                                       There will also be different opportunities scheduled to serve the community and those in need.
                                     </br></br>
