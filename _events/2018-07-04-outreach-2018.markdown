### July 4th Outreach

Freedom Reach Out
July 4th

The Ottumwa community was served on the 4th of July by FCOB with your family and friends at the old Target parking lot! The grills were lit and we handed out hot dogs and chips to everybody coming to watch the fireworks! There were also be kids activities such as a bounce house and giveaways and many more for adults as well!
